# Hola! 👋

I'm Borja (/Bohr-huh/), and I am a Computer Scientist from Barcelona based in Dublin, Ireland with experience in computer vision, graphics, animation, advanced algorithms, and web technologies. I am passionate about finding new ways technology can impact our lives. I got my Bachelor of Engineering in Informatics Engineering from the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya in 2020 and my Master of Science in Computer Science from Trinity College Dublin in August 2023. When not coding, I dedicate my time to graphic design, illustration, and cooking.
